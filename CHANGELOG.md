### Changes ###

  * [Tags]: Use my new/old name tag format [name:MER:gradient] instead of [name:abbrev:medium] in various unitframes
  *         Note: It will be reaction color in instanced content, not a gradient.
  * [UnitFrames]: Bring back Power Bar gradient texture
  * [Install]: Both install steps from the UnitFrame Layout should work again
  * [NamePlates]: CastBar Shield icon was missing, now it's back
