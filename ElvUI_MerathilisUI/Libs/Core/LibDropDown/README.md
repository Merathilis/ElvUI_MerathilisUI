# LibDropDown

This is a library addon for the popular MMORPG "World of Warcraft.

## Description

LibDropDown is a widget library that allows a developer to easily implement fully featured, taint-free dropdown menus and buttons to any AddOn.  
It has feature parity with [UIDropDownMenu](https://www.townlong-yak.com/framexml/live/UIDropDownMenu.lua) (as far I can tell, let me know if I missed something), in addition to some extra features and tweaks.

For details on how to implement this in your own addon, please see the wiki:
